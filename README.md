The first task is to harness our creativity and design a room to challenge and engage the hero.In the depths of the labyrinth, not only do we have to make the hero navigate through the treacherous rooms, but they must also confront an array of monstrous creatures that lurk in the darkness. As the labyrinth evolves, so do the monsters that inhabit it. Now, it is our responsiblity to breathe life into a terrifying new monster, one that will strike fear into the heart of any hero who dares to enter its domain.
